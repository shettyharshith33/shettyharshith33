# Hey, I’m Harshith 👋  
**Android Engineer in the making | MCA | Problem Solver**

I don’t just write code —  
I **ship apps**, break them on purpose, and rebuild them better.

---

## 🚀 What I Do
- 📱 Build **Android apps** using **Kotlin & Java** (Jetpack Compose preferred)
- 🧠 Practice **DSA daily** to stay calm when interviews try to do the opposite
- 🔥 Turn ideas → working products (with real users, not just demos)
- 🐞 Debug like a detective, not a guesser

> I believe consistency beats motivation — that’s how *Streakify* was born.

## 🧩 Currently Focused On
- Clean architecture in Android (MVVM, state handling, performance)
- Writing **interview-proof DSA code**
- Shipping small features fast instead of dreaming about big apps forever

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I track habits with an app I built myself —  
because **discipline scales better than motivation**.
